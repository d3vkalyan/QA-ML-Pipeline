How to export your report as a PDF file by clicking the“Export to PDF”
You can choose, would you prefer to turn into PDF the whole report with all tabs created or select a tab needed.

Press the variant you choose, and the PDF generation will begin.
By default, this PDF includes only report data, but you have an option to add some text, image or even another PDF as a header. Let’s try it an example of a company logo. That is the thing you will definitely need when sending your PDF reports somewhere else.
To add a company logo to report PDF press tab “Report Settings” on the top right of the report web-page and select “Edit PDF header” item in the pop-up menu.

Press the “Add widgets” button on the top right and select “Image upload” option in following menu.

Drag & Drop file with your logo to the highlighted area or browse for it and press “Apply”.

Click cogwheel icon in the File upload widget top right corner to edit uploaded image if needed. You can add or remove captions, resize your image, select placement (on the top or the bottom of the page), return to widget setup or delete this image at all.

Return to your report with “back to report” button on the left or create a PDF with “Export to PDF” at the top right corner. Anyway, now “export to PDF” will automatically add selected image on every page of resulting PDF file.

You can export your report as a PDF file and start sending newer versions of this file to a number of clients every day, week or month.
